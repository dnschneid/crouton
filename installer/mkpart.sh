USAGE="$APPLICATION [-s size|-c size|-d|-x] [-i number]

Create a separate partition for crouton, immune from accidental wiping when
switching back and forth to developer/normal mode.

This script needs to log the user out, and reboot the system. Make sure no
unsaved document/form is left unsaved.

Under normal circumstances, the stateful partition will not be damaged.
However, it is recommended to backup data as required (Downloads folder,
existing chroots in /usr/local).

$APPLICATION must be run as root.

It is highly recommended to run this from a crosh shell (Ctrl+Alt+T), not VT2.

Basic options:
    -s size     Set the size in megabytes of the stateful partition, the rest
                being allocated to crouton.
                Default: $STATEFULSIZE MB
                Minimum allowed size: $MINIMUMSTATEFULSIZE MB
    -c size     Set the size in megabytes of the crouton partition.
    -d          Delete a partition, and reset the stateful partition to its
                maximum size. The partition to remove is autodetected using its
                label (CROUTON), but it can be specified using '-i number'.
                WARNING: This wipes the content of the crouton partition.

Options for power users only:
    -i number   The partition number to use for crouton. This script will fail
                if the partition exists and is larger than a single sector.
                Default: $CROUTONPARTNUMBER
    -x          Do not create the new partition: only switch off all services,
                switch to VT2, so that the partition layout can be edited
                manually.
