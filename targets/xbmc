### Append to prepare.sh:
install xbmc

# Configure keymaps xbmc for the hotkeys ctr-shift-alt F1/F2 to
# cycle through chroots/chromeos. We use ~/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/keyboard.xml
# for this purpose, but the main user may not have been created yet, so we 
# add a script in /etc/profile.d to link ~/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/keyboard.xml
# to /etc/crouton/xbmc-keyboard.xml

profiledsh='/etc/profile.d/crouton-xbmc-keymaps.sh'
# Make sure symbolic link is setup on login
echo '#!/bin/sh

keyboardxmldir="$HOME/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps"
# Do not install if user is root, or $HOME does not exist
if [ "`id -u`" -ne 0 -a -d "$HOME" -a ! -e "$keyboardxmldir/keyboard.xml" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$keyboardxmldir"
    ln -sfT /etc/crouton/xbmc-keyboard.xml "$keyboardxmldir/keyboard.xml"
fi' > "$profiledsh"

chmod 755 "$profiledsh"
