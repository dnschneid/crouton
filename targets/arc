### Append to prepare.sh:
#Make an SDcard directory. Lets assume host exists and create the directory directly.
echo "Creating directories..."
mkdir -p /var/host/sdcard/write
mkdir -p /var/host/sdcard/read
#Add the arc group to the chroot. This does a cheaky bypass to allow the user access to the SDCard by matching the GID (Thank you Linux Security.)
echo "Creating arc-group."
groupadd -g 665357 arc-group
