# This isn't a real target; it's the boilerplate that the other targets source.
# The targets are simply sourced inside of install.sh, and so can expect to have
# access to all all-caps variables (by convention; not a technical restriction).

# Additionally, this common script expects the sourcing script to set
# DESCRIPTION with the description of the target, and REQUIRES with a
# space-separated list of other targets it needs.

# The script can also specify a space-separated list of targets in PROVIDES;
# this will prevent other targets from installing when this one is done first.

# Finally, targets can set HOSTBIN, CHROOTBIN, and CHROOTETC with a
# space-separated list of files to copy from host-bin, chroot-bin, and
# chroot-etc into the appropriate places.

# All targets must be idempotent since the user may Ctrl-C the process and run
# it again.
