### Append to prepare.sh:

# Link the timezone to Chrome OS
# Remove /etc/timezone: this tells Ubuntu/Debian that we are managing the
# content of /etc/localtime manually, and that it should not erase the symbolic
# link upon update, unless "dpkg-reconfigure tzdata" is called explicitly.
rm -f /etc/timezone

# /var/host/timezone/localtime is itself a symbolic link, but as long as the
# zoneinfo packages in the chroot and Chrome OS are the same, it should be fine
ln -sfT /var/host/timezone/localtime /etc/localtime

# Add the primary user
