# This script generates a crx extension package, and is meant to be used by
# developers: Users should download the extension from the Web Store.
#
# We could leverage on Chrome to build the extension, using something like
# /opt/google/chrome/chrome --pack-extension=crouton
# However many versions cannot build the package without crashing:
#  - 27.0.1453.116 aborts at the end of the process, but the package still
#    looks fine.
#  - 28.0.1500.95 aborts before creating the extension.
#
# This code is loosely based a script found along the CRX file format
# specification: http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/crx.html
