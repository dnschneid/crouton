USAGE="${0##*/} [session]
A wrapper around gnome-session that can be passed to xinit.
Provide the session type in the DESKTOP_SESSION variable, 
or as an optional session argument.

Examples:
(launch GNOME from crosh with session in DESKTOP_SESSION)
DESKTOP_SESSION=gnome xinit /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ${0##*/}

(launch Unity from an xterm with session as an argument)
${0##*/} ubuntu"

export DESKTOP_SESSION="${DESKTOP_SESSION:-"$1"}"
SESSION='gnome-session'
CINNAMON_SESSION='cinnamon-session'

if [ -z "$DESKTOP_SESSION" ]; then
    echo "$USAGE" 1>&2
    exit 2
fi

# Cinnamon 2.0 and later uses its own fork of gnome-session
if [ "${DESKTOP_SESSION#cinnamon}" != "$DESKTOP_SESSION" ] && \
        hash "$CINNAMON_SESSION" 2>/dev/null; then
    SESSION="$CINNAMON_SESSION"
fi

if [ -z "$DISPLAY" ]; then
    exec xinit /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc "$0"
else
    exec "$SESSION" --session="$DESKTOP_SESSION"
fi
