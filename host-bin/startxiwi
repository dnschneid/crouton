USAGE="$APPLICATION [options] chroot_app [parameters]

Wraps enter-chroot to launch a window or tab in Chromium OS for any graphical application.
Applications launched in this way show in independent windows or tabs.

By default, it will use the primary user on the first xiwi-enabled chroot found and launch
the chroot_app in a window.

Options:
$("$ENTERCHROOT" -h 2>&1 | grep -e ' -[bckntu]')
    -F          Launch the chroot_app full-screen.
    -T          Launch the chroot_app in a tab.
    -f          Prevent xiwi from quitting automatically. (see NOTE below)

NOTE:
xiwi will normally close when the application returns. Some gui applications
fork before or during normal operation, which can confuse xiwi and cause it to
quit prematurely. If your application does not have a parameter that prevents
it from forking, and crouton is unable to automatically detect the fork, you can
use -f to prevent xiwi from quitting automatically.
xiwi will quit if you close the Chromium OS window when nothing is displayed.
  
You can cycle through multiple windows inside the application
via Ctrl-Alt-Tab/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Tab, or close them via Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Escape.
If the chroot_app begins with 'start' but you still want to
use the default window manager, specify the full path of the application.
