# Test upgrade path from Ubuntu quantal to trusty.
# Since raring reached EOL before qantal, upgrading from quantal skips raring.
# So we test quantal->saucy->trusty, raring->saucy.
# Also test precise->trusty (LTS, upgrade not suggested until July 2014)

# Format: FIRST;NEXT;DEV;PROMPT
# FIRST: release to start with
# NEXT: list of releases to be upgraded to
# DEV: one additional release, for which upgrading is not recommended yet
# PROMPT: choose normal or lts upgrade
